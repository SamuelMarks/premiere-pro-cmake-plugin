[Adobe](https://adobe.com) provides a C++ API to build plugins for its suite, including [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/premiere.html).

Unfortunately they provide separate [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) project files, meaning additional build flags and dependencies (like third-party libraries) need to be manually added to each.

CMake has become the default 'standard' for cross-platform builds; popularly for C and C++.

This project aims to be a good starter for cross-platform Premiere Pro plugin development, including those that have third-party dependencies.

## vcpkg
[`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io) is an open-source cross-platform library package management system from [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com); targeting macOS, Linux, and Windows.

It's very popular, and has strong CMake integration. Henceforth, it is chosen for this project as an example of third-party library integration.

[Install vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html), configure it with your system. Then run:

    [root]/vcpkg/vcpkg install openssl zlib

## Premiere Pro SDK
Due to licensing issues, this cannot be included directly. You must specify it in the [build](#Build) step with `-DADOBE_PP_SDK`. Download the SDK here; then unzip: https://console.adobe.io/servicesandapis

Tested with:

  - Premiere Pro CC 13.0 Mac SDK [CC 2019 ; Release 1 - Oct 2018]
    - unzip and set `-DADOBE_PP_SDK` to that dir

## Build

    $ mkdir 'cmake-build-debug' && cd "$_"
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE='[root]/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake' \
            -DADOBE_PP_SDK='[path_to_pp_sdk]' \
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE='Debug' \
            ..
    $ cmake --build .
